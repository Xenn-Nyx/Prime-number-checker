Prime-number-checker
Checks for prime numbers between certain range of values.
Does not use a mathematical formula (guaranteed to find all values in a range, but slow).

Input a range of values to check in the format [lower bound]-[upper bound].
Enter a 1 or 0 to turn silent mode on (1) or off (0)
The program will handle the rest
